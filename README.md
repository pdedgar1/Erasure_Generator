# Permutational_Eraser
A Claude-Coded erasure "generator"(?) for the facilitation of found language! 

## Process
Here's the prompt that I plugged into Claude Sonnet 4 on May 25, 2025: 

"I have an idea for an interactive poetry-generator; I'd love to try to make a basic html interface where someone could upload a text file and then use some sliders or checkboxes at the top of the screen to erase every 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, etc word based on the space characters in the provided text. Maybe the user could toggle between doing it by word based on the spaces, and by character, based on each individual character in the text file! I'd like the site to only be able to take .txt files (and tell the user that), and then I'd also like it to not "delete" the text in the display, but rather replace the words/characters with spaces, so maybe the text can display in a monotype font. Does that make sense? I will take the code we're working with and run it in Github so that I can test it!"

I thought I'd have to iterate this a number of times, but other than cosmetic elements like the title I used and the color of the page, I didn't have to change a thing. It's kind of freaky. Anyways, let me know if you used this and if it was useful to you!
#### Invitation
If you make any original work using this tool, I'd love to see it at remediatelitmag.xyz, the magazine I run that solicits computer-assisted creative writing! 

## Other Blackout Poetry Tools
A cursory Google search for similar tools renders very little in the way of a simple interface for creative manipulation only. I've listed the others below to credit other sites doing simliar work! 

#### [Blackout Poetry Generator](https://blackout-poetry-generator.vercel.app)
A tool coded by a /Real person/, [github user @zhaovan](https://github.com/zhaovan/blackout-poetry-generator), to make blackout poetry either randomly or with a Markov tool that apparently takes into account the types of words in the set before erasing. 
#### [Blackout Poetry Maker](https://blackoutpoetry.glitch.me)
Another tool coded by another /real person/, [Dr. Emma Winston](https://emmawinston.me). This interface is a little different from the other blackout poetry makers, allowing the user to select and unselect the words they're /keeping/, not the words they want blacked out.This feature is fully dependent on user interaction, not permutationally erasing like "every 5th".
#### [ErasureMaker](http://erasure.alanharnum.ca/edit.html) 
A tool coded by another /real person/, [Alan Harnum](https://www.alanharnum.ca/page/projects/). I like that in this one you get to choose the format of the erasure you make (fading out, strikethrough, blackout, fully-erased). You can also, similar to the one I had Claude code, choose between erasing words, characters, and Title. This feature is fully dependent on user interaction, not permutationally erasing like "every 5th". Previous excerpts and erasures are stored in the site as well, so one may read others' erasures! 
#### [Proceedural Erasure Poetry Generator](https://empowermint.github.io/erasurepoetry/)
Another tool coded by another /real person/, James T. Harding, [aka empowermint](https://github.com/empowermint/erasurepoetry). I like that this one is automatic but in some ways random. The variability here is really nice!

## Algorithmic Tools
### Erasure Poet
This [Erasure Poetry Creaton](https://www.yeschat.ai/gpts-9t557IEEGMp-Erasure-Poet) chatbot really just seems like a bootstrapped AI Chatbot on "YesChatAI" linked up to Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok. It's not a permutational/computational tool, but an algorithmic generator. In my experience, text generators are unreliable text erasers. 

## Non-poetic tools 
### Text Cleaner and Text Formatter 
At [Text Cleaner](https://textcleaner.net/#google_vignette), a user can upload text and perform a variety of clean-ups, like removing tabs, spaces, and line breaks, specific characters, convert file types, and so on.
