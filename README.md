# Erasure_Generator
A Claude-Coded erasure generator for the facilitation of found language! 

Here's the prompt that I plugged into Claude Sonnet 4 on May 25, 2025: 
"I have an idea for an interactive poetry-generator; I'd love to try to make a basic html interface where someone could upload a text file and then use some sliders or checkboxes at the top of the screen to erase every 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, etc word based on the space characters in the provided text. Maybe the user could toggle between doing it by word based on the spaces, and by character, based on each individual character in the text file! I'd like the site to only be able to take .txt files (and tell the user that), and then I'd also like it to not "delete" the text in the display, but rather replace the words/characters with spaces, so maybe the text can display in a monotype font. Does that make sense? I will take the code we're working with and run it in Github so that I can test it!"
